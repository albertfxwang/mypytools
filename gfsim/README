A new, object-oriented version for running GALFIT simulations with artificial
objects. Meant to replace run_sim_multiband_galfit, and part of it should be
branched out for SExtractor-only simulations.

Will contain the following files:
- prep_gfsim: prepare images for GAFLIT simulations if necessary (e.g., when
  differnt pixel scales are used for detection and measurement images)
- run_gfsim: driver script that reads in the parameter file and runs the 
  simulations
