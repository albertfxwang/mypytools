This is a bunch of python utilities written for the GOODS project,
mostly by H. Ferguson (ferguson@stsci.edu) from 2002-2010. You are
free to use these as you see fit.

angsep.py        - compute the angular separation between two sources
coords.py        - various coordinate utilities
cosmo.py         - some basicl cosmological calculations
doc/             - some documentation
__init__.py      - initialization
kennicutt.py     - Kennicutt law
image_moments.py - Computes various image moments a la SExtractor
iterstat.py      - Simple mean, stdev with iterative sigma clipping
match.py         - brute force coordinate matching. Slow but it works 
numprint.py      - formatted  printing of numpy arrays. 
parseconfig.py   - read in SExtractor configuration files
readcol.py       - read in column-oriented files 
setup.py         - distribution utility
sextutils.py	 - Routine for reading & writing sextractor files
iterstat.py      - Iterative sigma-clipped mean & standard deviation
imutil.py        - Utilities for dealing with images
